## BLHeli_32 MCUs 
BLHeli_32 supports a variety of MCUs, in order to maximize performance and also to handle the current chip shortage.  
Unfortunately there is inaccurate and misleading information relating to this circulating in various media.

So to clarify:  
All BLHeli_32 MCUs (F0, F3, F4, G0 etc) support the "ByRPM" feature, with Rev32.9 code.  
All BLHeli_32 MCUs (F0, F3, F4, G0 etc) support "any" pwm frequency range.  
The supported range is determined by the hardware manufacturer, based upon choice of fets, driver capacitors etc.
